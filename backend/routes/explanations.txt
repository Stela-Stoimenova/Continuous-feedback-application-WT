A route decides: When someone makes a request to a URL 
-> what controller function runs?

So:
POST/activities is creating a new activity 
etc...

POST http://localhost:3000/api/activities
goes to the router
which goes to the controllerwhich talks to the model
which talks to the database
returns a response
