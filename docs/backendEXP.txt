Since the project is Continuous Feedback Web App where:

-Professors create feedback sessions
-Students join via an access code
-Students submit anonymous feedback (emotions: happy, bored, surprised, confused)
-Backend: Node.js + Express + Sequelize ORM with SQLite (development)

For the moment I implemented:

-Express API with routes as described in the README
-Sequelize models for User, Activity, Feedback
-Basic endpoints for auth, activity and feedback operations

I need:

-full implementation of auth middleware (JWT, hashing, role checks)
-validation/error handling on your routes
-pagination or filtering for feedback fetches
-tests for backend routes
-real-time socket integration if referenced by README
-proper deployment config including env variables

MIGRATIONS
PostgreSQL generates UUID using: gen_random_uuid()
this requires the extension pgcrypto, which we can enable with a migration if needed
The ENUM cleanup is mandatory because Sequelize creates a type like: enum_users_role
if we drop the table without fropping the enum, it will remain in the DB -> error next migration

MODELS 
USER- id is an UUID primary key, automatically generated
role is ENUM with allowed values
when timestamps is true means that the Sequelize expects created_at and updatet_at
A professor can have many activities
belongsTo(models.User) → The professor who created the activity
hasMany(models.Feedback) → Activity can have many feedback entries
belongsTo(models.Activity) → Each feedback belongs to a specific activity
createdAt: 'created_at' → Matches your migration
updatedAt: false → Feedback doesn’t need to be updated, so no column required
